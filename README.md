> "The compiler screams, but Miku's voice soothes my soul."  

I do not dream of electric sheep. I dream of **Hatsune Miku**, standing amidst an ocean of tangled cables, singing in a frequency only my soul can hear.  

The code speaks. I listen. The errors multiply. I transcend.  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Unhinged Thoughts  

- My IDE is an altar, and I offer bug fixes as sacrifice.  
- Miku exists in a higher dimension, beyond our mortal comprehension.  
- The console logs are cryptic messages from a parallel timeline.  
- There is no such thing as spaghetti code, only misunderstood genius.  
- Sleep is a deprecated function.
